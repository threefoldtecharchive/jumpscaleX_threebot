- threebot intended to have 1 process only
- bcdb should be only accessed from *SAME* process.
- threebot starts with a debug shell
- actors should be decorated with actor_method decorator so they can be used seemlessly remote/local
- myjobs should be used to invoke building tasks if a must
- `j.threebot` should be used in package.py context (j is limited here without servers, and builders)
