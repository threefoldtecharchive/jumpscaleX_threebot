# Team

This macro can be used to generate the data required for our [docify plugin](https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_weblibs/tree/master/static/team) for listing of team members.

### Syntax:

```
!!!team("link_to_data_team_repo")
```

or using toml (inside a code block)

````
```
!!!team
link = "data_team_repo"
```
````

The **link** can be in the format of our [custom links](../links.md).

`link` is the link to data directory at the data repository it should follow the same format described [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/data_team)(also the list of project ids and contribution types).


### Other options
* `order`: the order of team members listing, either `rank` or `random`.
* `projects`: a list of project ids to filter by
* `contribution_types`: a list of contribution ids to filter by


### Examples
