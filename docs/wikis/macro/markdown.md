# Markdown
Use this macro to include mardown text from a google doc into your documents.


## Examples:
````
```
!!!markdown
url = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8fydUhQ1HTlt1zabbF9pJM1JHGkI_-58BygtsyWy0c/edit"
```
````

the macro reads plain text from the google doc, so the text should be in a proper markdown format.
