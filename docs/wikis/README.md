# Wikis

Wikis are a collection of docsites, which are a collection of markdown documents, images and files.

A [simple docsite](examples/simple) can only consists of two files, `README.md` and `_sidebar.md`, the later is used for navigation in [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/more-pages?id=sidebar).

We use [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/) to get an html web page directly from markdown, we also use our [3git](https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core/tree/development/JumpscaleCore/tools/threegit) tool to pre-process this docsites to support some markdown extenstions like [macros](macro/README.md).


Some wikis can be found at [threefoldfoundation](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation) organization on github like:
* [Foundation](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation)
* [Tokens](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens)

All wikis are now hosted at [https://wiki.grid.tf/](https://wiki.grid.tf/), for example foundation wiki can be found at [https://wiki.grid.tf/wiki/foundation](https://wiki.grid.tf/wiki/foundation).
