## Ubuntu

A free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian.
Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core
(for internet of things devices and robots).

All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine.
Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.

Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years.
The latest release is 19.04 ("Disco Dingo"), and the most recent long-term support release is
18.04 LTS ("Bionic Beaver"), which is supported until 2023 under public support and until 2028
as a paid option.

Ubuntu is developed by Canonical and the community under a meritocratic governance model.

Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the
release date and until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date.

Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu.

Ubuntu is named after the African philosophy of ubuntu, which Canonical translates as
"humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".
