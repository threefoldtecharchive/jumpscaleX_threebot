## Quake
A first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by GT Interactive in 1996.
It is the first game in the Quake series.

In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments
while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry.

The successor to id Software's Doom series, Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.

Unlike the Doom engine before it, the Quake engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had
early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL.
After Doom helped to popularize multiplayer deathmatches in 1993, Quake added various
multiplayer options. Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update
and software such as QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against
others on the Internet easier and more reliable.

Quake features music composed by Trent Reznor and his band, Nine Inch Nails.
The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with lots of stone textures and a
rustic, capitalized font.
