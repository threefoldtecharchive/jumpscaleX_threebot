The solutions achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) - and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry :-)\n\nRead more at this blog: [10x times power savings, is this possible?][4]\n\n### internet capacity is expensive\n\nBiggest cost of running IT architectures are people\n\nToday's complex, built out of ‘band aid and patches’ point solutions, organically grown and badly documented IT infrastructures need an armada of people to keep it ticking. Find an example IT budget [here][5]. Even though this is an example budget one can learn a lot from the trend that are presented in the example:\n\n* On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues\n* IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of FTE in the company of which 85% are insource and 15% is on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn't retain internal know how how to operate their IT.\n* Just under 50% of the IT budget is spent on Infrastructure and operations and a similar amount is spent on Applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.\n* Around 65% of the IT budget is spend on resources and services, around 35% is spend on Hard and Software.\n\n\nThese figures presents industry average number but they still paint a troubling picture that the cost of IT are a sizeable part of an overall budget and most spend is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture on which the whole company operations rely - for any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and it's continuity - strangely not for IT.\n\n### people are source of downtime, we need more intelligence\n\nBiggest source of downtime in computer systems are people\n\nGetting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large [organisation][6] providing cloud services.\n\n20+ years ago when internet datacenters came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP'’) the level of complication in architecting, building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed and the obtained results send back to end users often many hundreds of kilometers away.\n\nManaging a datacenter that contains solutions for transporting information, for storing information and to process information is not an easy feat and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented processing and storing this information has also exploded which as a combination results in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build operate and maintain these.\n\nThe time has come that we refly on people not anymore to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on this information being available is huge. Manual deployments and operational responsibility by people is not providing the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of Information Technology and let smart systems take over.\n\n### internet is growing too fast, we need better solutions\n\nThe current growth of internet needs 4000+ new big data centers of computer systems\n\nThe global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average year over year growth from 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013*. To host all this data over 4000 new big data centers need to be built. To achieve this goal, $ trillion USD investment capital are needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed [e.g. siemens innovation strategy][7].\n\n[0]: http://www.datacentermap.com/\n[1]: http://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7?international=true&r=US&IR=T\n[2]: https://www.article19.org/data/files/Internet_Statement_Adopted.pdf\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\n[4]: /information/10-times-power-savings/\n[5]: http://www.gartner.com/downloads/public/explore/metricsAndTools/ITBudget_Sample_2012.pdf\n[6]: https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/\n[7]: https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/innovation-strategy/driving-forward-digitalization.html","content_with_meta":"---\ntitle: \"Internet is growing wild\"\nauthor: Andreas\ntags: edge cloud, tech\npublished_at: 2017-9-12\npost_image: internet-is-growing.jpg\n---\n\n![Logo](../assets/images/internet-is-growing.jpg)\n## Internet is growing in a way which is not sustainable, there needs to be an alternative\n\n### internet capacity needs to become local\n\nBig majority of users in the world connect to servers not being present in their region and as such experience higher cost & low performance\n\nAccording to a study of [datacentermap.com][0] 80% of the datacenters of internet service providers are based in the US and Europe.

The Edge internet needs a different approach.\n\n\nThreeFold technology breaks with the traditional IT model. The Edge internet needs a different approach.\n\nThreeFold's open-source tech addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues - by simplifying architectures and not relying on third party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.\n\n### What is our Technology Toolbox?\n\nTF technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our “Technology Toolbox\".\n\n- Stateless Computing: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity\n\n- Self-Healing Technology controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.\n\n- Blockchain Technology, via Rivine.io,  our secure, scalable “proof of stake” blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads and heightened security.\n\n\n## Why Stateless Computing?\n\nThe global Edge internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the Edge internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc  \n\nOpen-source components have been developed, Zero-OS,for the deployment of bare metal machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.  Our Zero-OS platform runs containerized applications and software code on secure and distributed IT infrastructure.  Zero-OS can be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within our network\n\n### The benefits of Stateless Computing are substantial, including:\n- Performance: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines\n- Free: finds the optimal performance of server & storage nodes at no cost\n- Private: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another\n- Distributed: capacity is generated without the need for datacenters: At The Edge\n- High-available: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments\n- Portability: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant\n- Secure: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors\n- Green: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption.\n\n## Self-Healing Technology: self-healing and self driving\n\nJumpscale framework and ZeroRobot allow the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment.\n\nOur robots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure and runtime environments, guaranteeing performance & availability of applications.\n\n### The benefits of our Self-Healing Technology protocols include the following:\n\n- Self-Healing: the platform regenerates when health issues are detected that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications\n- Intelligence: agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications\n- Lifecycle Management: the status of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded\n- Autoscaling: the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance.\n\n## Blockchain Technology: Executing workloads and applications via smart contracts using new consensus algorithms\n\nThe engineers developed new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this into our Rivine.io open-source blockchain software\n\nUnlike the “proof of work” blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine.io blockchain is scalable, green and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third party software\n\nIn addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed itsyou.online, identity and access management platform.  Itsyou.online uses three factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution\n\n### The benefits of TF blockchain technology and identity management platform include:\n\n- Green: our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks\n- Lowest possible cost of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system\n- Neutral: state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner\n- Payment fulfillment: transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens\n- Smart Contracts: fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying Internet IT capacity.\n\nAll of our technology is open-source and can be accessed in the following Github Repos:\n\n* Zero-OS:\t\t        https://github.com/Zero-OS\n* Jumpscale: \t\t\t    https://github.com/jumpscale\n* At Your Service (AYS): \thttps://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9\n* Rivine: \t\t\t    https://github.com/rivine/rivine","content_with_meta":"---\ntitle: \"Technology for a New Internet\"\nauthor: Weynand\ntags: tech, internet\npublished_at: 2017-9-12\npost_image: technology-for-internet.jpg\n---\n\n![Logo](../assets/images/technology-for-internet.jpg)\n## Our technology breaks with the traditional IT model.

Itsyou.online uses three factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution\n\n### The benefits of TF blockchain technology and identity management platform include:\n\n- Green: our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks\n- Lowest possible cost of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system\n- Neutral: state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner\n- Payment fulfillment: transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens\n- Smart Contracts: fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying Internet IT capacity.\n\nAll of our technology is open-source and can be accessed in the following Github Repos:\n\n* Zero-OS:\t\t        https://github.com/Zero-OS\n* Jumpscale: \t\t\t    https://github.com/jumpscale\n* At Your Service (AYS): \thttps://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9\n* Rivine: \t\t\t    https://github.com/rivine/rivine\n","tags":["tech","internet"],"published_at":"2017-9-12","author_name":"ahmed","author_email":"ahmed@there.com","author_image":"me.jpg","post_image":"technology-for-internet.jpg","excerpt":"\nOur technology breaks with the traditional IT model.

But it does so in a more efficient way than the current Docker engine - the most used and known container technology platform.\n\n### IAAS\n\nThe TF-node technology enables hardware capabilities to be used for IAAS services in a very efficient way.  Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been implemented over the last decade to patch scaling and performance problems. Our engineers have always looked at the root cause of issues and by innovating at the core algorithm level solved issues. Examples are:\n\n- **Less is more**: Scale down the operating system for a virtualisation architecture to a minimum and boot it over the network - no local operating system files installed on local storage.\n- **Look at root causes, do not invent painkillers**: Step away from existing storage solutions that have a need for proprietary acceleration hardware and use standard off the shelf, affordable and efficient components with a 100% software based storage solution that is able to withstand hardware failures without requiring human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage solution that can operate standalone.\n\nThe platform is secure by using a network boot mechanism making it virtually hack resistant because there are no operating system files installed locally.\nInfrastructure as a service traditionally runs in hyperscale datacenters remote from the businesses using it. TF-node technology allows you to install, operate and run IAAS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team.  It operates on a peer2peer network only transferring bits of data that need to be transported avoiding network congestion and traffic bottlenecks.\n\n### Archive\n\nData generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This data needs to be archived. The TF-node technology creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and known interfaces will be build by developers wordwide and made available (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS and NFS).  The low levels storage functionality supports version controlling of the archived data which keeps all relevant changes without any limitation by using a small amount of actual storage capacity.  \n\nData security and reliability are key aspects of any storage system.  The TF-node allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location taking away the risk of data being stolen (physically) and that of a site outage leading to a data outage.  The distributed character of the system is inline with the increasing spread of actual data generation.  We have sensory equipment everywhere these days and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous  Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.\n\n### Data Mining\n\nOn traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. The distributed character of the TF-node technology presents compute and storage capacity everywhere.  This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data.  Data is stored in a distributed manner and therefore data mining can happen in a distributed manner as well. Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages like python, lua, javascript and golang. Data mining follows distributed data storage.\n\nNever run into scalability problems again - the TF-node data store can expand horizontally using thousands of distributed nodes to create large storage volumes.\n\n### Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are applications that run on a decentralised platform, exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference . These apps run on a blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. Smart contracts enable developers to create markets, store registries of debts (or promises), move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things without a middleman or counterparty risk.  TF-nodes run.\n\n\nThe TF-node technology natively supports the existing Ethereum network  and will have it's own way of running smart contracts by deploying a new blockchain technology, presenting a whole new approach on how to run  blockchain.\n\n### Self Learning & AI\n\nBlockchains can be seen as databases. By current database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughput, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But even with these terrible characteristics blockchains introduce three new and important characteristics:\n\n- Decentralized data and shared data control.  Very simply said this leads to more data and qualitative better data which result in better models. Shortening the machine learning time and get AI progressing in a much faster pace.  \n- Immutable audit trails improve the trustworthiness of the data & models increasing provenance on training and testing results.\n- Native assets and  assets exchanges make  training and testing models intellectual property (IP) assets, which enhancing decentralized data & model exchanges.\n\nBlockchain technology allows more data and with better quality to be presented to machine learning algorithms.  It has been proven (Microsoft researchers Banko and Brill) that more data — not just a bit more data but orders of magnitude more data — while  using same algorithms results in a lot better machine learning.

The average cost per rack in a hyper scale data center is 20-35K USD including all energy, safety systems. The cost of the hardware per rack is around the 200-300k USD mark;\n\nWhat is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and therefore highly concentrated is complex and has a specific set of problems to deal with. Resource requirements for example, such as investment, operational costs, knowledge and people.\n\nIn reality keeping things simple and small is much more cost effective than a big complex environment.\n\n### Myth 2: big data centers can be made green.\n\nThe carbon footprint of a big datacenter is enormous. To improve the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) most data center farmers have adopted wind, hydro and/or solar power technologies, which indeed helps drop their PUE by an estimated 20%.\n\nThis 20% looks great on paper and in the farmers' corporate social responsibility reports. It is mostly, however, just an improvement on the cooling technology, not the actual energy consumed by the equipment that runs in their data centers (servers, storage chassis', physical disks, etc) and this equipment is what makes up the 100% of the carbon footprint. PUE only refers to overhead power consumption, ie. cooling  the facility, opening and closing doors, maintaining power security systems, etc.\n\nSo real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual Internet IT capacity to run workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks and storage cabinets. Improving on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of 1000% and lead to 10 times more power efficiency.\n\n### Myth 3: redundant systems have a better uptime.\n\nA lot of us have been raised to believe that systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability.

In fact, we believe we can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint by up to 10 times compared to other industry standard IT capacity producing solutions.\n\nPower consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance requiring more racks and more cooling.\n\nOur solutions achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so we use fewer racks), and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry.

This has further complicated IT architectures and has resuted in loss of actual end user workload performance. By eliminating these layers of complexity the resulting cloud stack presents minimal overhead and therefore requires less hardware which results in lower heat generation requiring less cooling. By producing less power, the net result is a total energy consumption decrease by a factor of 2 to 5.\n\n#### Self-Healing\n\nKeeping things up and running is a business model in modern day IT.  Major vendors earn most of their margin by selling maintenance contracts, performance guarantees, and professional services. Given their business model, there is little to no incentive to make things simple and efficient. Creating a self-healing environment requires minimal manual intervention to replace broken hardware components. Broken hardware components are inevitable, and the Zero-OS distributed node architecture deals with such failures by turning off broken components and provisioning unused capacity. Not having to ship broken parts back and forth together with the corresponding installation knowledge (engineers) means a much smaller carbon emission footprint.\n\n#### “No painkiller” approach\n\nIf a specific piece of software or hardware is not delivering the required performance or reliability, we should analyze the core design/algorithm and its usage of soft/hard components to determine root causes of persistent issues and solve for that. Currently, most storage vendors follow the path of least resistance when trying to improve on performance, and their solution for meeting performance targets is to use faster components (CPU, memory, network card, proprietary acceleration) rather than looking at the core algorithms that drive the utilization of those components. Swapping components for faster ones perpetuates a cycle of cutting corners and a focuses reliance on innovation from hardware component providers rather than solving the more fundamental and underlying issues.\n\nBy using these three principles, a Zero-OS node has a minimal power consumption footprint. Some key examples how this is achieved:\n\n#### Minimise the number of context switches\n\nVirtualization adds a layer of software between the actual end-user workload and physical hardware, but it also allows for multiple workloads to run on the same hardware using excess capacity.  There is definitely merit in building a virtualization solution. Building an effective virtualization solution that does not require abundant context switching is key and is why Zero-OS has been developed.  Zero-OS uses a minimal linux kernel that allows for a number of user spaces to co-exist. In these user spaces, containerised versions of software can be run taking away the need to have a hypervisor and a virtual OS fueling the virtual machines. This minimises the required overhead for the host OS and takes away the need for a hypervisor and guest operating systems.\n\n#### Minimise the use of network connections\n\nSupercomputing delivered a large number of new technologies. But, not all of them present are very usable solutions for everyday workloads. One technology invented to make supercomputers powerful (fast) is the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). RDMA allowed physical CPU boards (containing both CPUs and memory) to access other CPU boards in memory stored data over a dedicated channel. This eliminated the need to transport data between CPU nodes over network connections (or other mainstream means to exchange data). The result of this is that a lot less overhead was created to allow for distributed end user workloads to operate over multiple physical cores. The leading brands of server and storage solutions have never considered nor implemented such mechanisms which has increased the need for faster and faster networks - increasing complexity, cost, effort and resources needed to operate the solution.\n\nBy using a different, more efficient means to exchange data between physical CPU units, we no longer require forests of switching gear.\n\n#### Minimise the use of number of disks\n\nThe storage solution uses slow and big - the bigger the better - HDD disks which drive in rack density and as they spin slower they consume less power and need less cooling.

Experts such as Bell Labs and Cisco believe the capacity requirement in the next decade will dramatically outstrip existing infrastructure - requiring an additional 400m servers - or approximately 4000 hyperscale datacenters - at a cost of $250 mio to $1 bn each.\n\nThe spectacular growth and advances of cloud computing that occurred over the last decade resulted in large part from “hyper-scale” efficiencies - ie centralising Internet infrastructure in very large $ billion data centers.  Today demand for Internet capacity already outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Self Healing Technology.  The existing hyperscale cloud architecture cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great.  \n\nThe challenges facing the Internet include the following::\n\n- $ Trillions of Investment Required.  In the next decade, the global internet infrastructure requires another 4,000 data centers (250M$ - $1bn+ each) to meet demand which would cost $ trillions - an impossible amount of money.\n\n- Impossible to scale the network connecting users to the hyperscale data centers.  Since Hyperscale data centers are built in large central locations, the network leading to these data centers is congested.  Even more, remote regions that are less connected to the internet cannot benefit from the data centers’ IT services.\n\n- Non-Local data and capacity.  Governments around the world are becoming more and more concerned about data leaving their borders - these governments require IT infrastructure to be local.  Furthermore, IoT workloads require local capacity to deliver constant real time computing and storage requirements - for certain applications and workloads (eg driverless cars), latency is not an option.   Hyperscale Data centers can simply not deliver to these requirements.\n\n- Non-secure / at risk of choke point failures.  There are plenty of recent well publicized problems with security, outages and lost data.  The reason for this is that centralised hyperscale architectures are inherently insecure - and failures at a single hyperscale location can cause widespread contagion and outages.\n\n\n\n## The ThreeFold Solution\n\nOur solution to these $trillion problems is to migrate Internet IT capacity to the Edge - ie a “hyper-distributed” network architecture, located close to users (in cities, schools, offices, homes and even vehicles).\n\nEdge networks will not necessarily replace the existing hyperscale capacity powering today’s cloud - rather, Edge networks will scale to meet the increased capacity demands going forward.\n\nBy 2025 60% of new internet infrastructure will be decentralized and located at the edge of the operator networks, using alternative locations which have stable (renewable) power and reliable connectivity.\n\nThe ThreeFold solution has following main benefits:\n\n\n### Secure\n\n- The Grid is distributed and benefits from our ItsYou.Online identity management platform - making it much more secure\n\n### Green\n\n- The technology avoids having to build huge power hungry datacenters (we are 10x more green).\n- The solution brings capacity where the consumers are = Cloud At The Edge\n- We make IT a true utility = IT As Energy (3x more uptime, 3-10x more cost effective)\n\n### Neutral\n\n- The solution enables 100% neutral & private Internet IT capacity.\n- Our blockchain technology provides security, neutrality & scale.\n\n\n## The ThreeFold Zero-Node\n\nA special box is built which is called the ThreeFold Zero-Node.\n\nThe Zero-Node provides blockchain, compute & storage capacity to the internet.\nThis capacity can be used for any possible workload.\n\nThe nodes are modular - scaling from 8 vCPUs and 3.5 TB of storage (smallest) to clusters with 8000 vCPUs and 2 peta-bytes of storage (large).\n\n### Our Zero-Nodes are green\n\n- For storage the boxes use about 10 times less energy, for other workloads typically about 2 to 3 times less energy.\n\n### Our Zero-Nodes are at the edge and save a lot of network traffic.\n\nOur Zero Operating System (\"Zero OS\") is ideally suited for Edge networking - where automation, self-healing and hyper-distribution are must-haves.  \n- The Zero-Nodes are deployed as close as possible to the consumers of Internet IT capacity (IoT, residential, business, government, education, …).\n- This results in massive bandwidth savings, we estimate to be able to keep 99% of the required bandwidth locally which has huge impact on cost.\n- This is the only viable solution to be able to provide internet to the 3.2 billion people waiting.\n\n### The Zero-Nodes are self healing & cost effective\n\n...

The internet gave us more power to share information in a decentralized way. In turn, the blockchain now allows us to decentalize value, which could change the world further.\n\nCompanies like Facebook, Google and Amazon made big business out of the internet. The “sharing economy” has been growing over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which:\n\n1. Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.\n2. Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of a marketplace operators.\n\nWe are at the dawn of a flat-structure economy. An economy where we need less managerial levels for the system to function in a good way.\n\nBlockchain technology facilitates this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis and form marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.\n\n### The internet is still centralized\n\nDespite already seeing many examples of decentralized currencies, transportation, and ledgers we do not yet have decentralized datacenter technology, the very core of the internet as we know it.\n\nTo compete in the internet capacity market which is currently dominated by big IT companies, requires massive investment and IT development.\n\nOver the last several years, ThreeFold has been developing decentralized datacenter technology that allows anyone to take part in the internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). \n\n### How to become a ThreeFold Farmer\n\nThe process of becoming a TF Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the TF Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS operating system onto nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold network. By doing so you will be an operator of a \"micro datacenter\" and earn TF Tokens. Anyone can become a TF Farmer, no matter the level of experience. Which means you can become an ‘Airbnb’ TF Farmer of the new, neutral internet which belongs to us all of us.\n\nInternet Capacity produced by a Zero-Node is automatically registered on the TF Directory. The TF Directory is a public directory of global purchasers of Internet Capacity. There is no need to build a marketing plan/department or to promote your available capacity.\n\nPricing is set by the TF Directory's algorithm based on numerous factors including real-time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment. TF Farmer are also allowed to set their own pricing.","content_with_meta":"---\ntitle: \"The AirBnB of Internet Capacity\"\nauthor: Roel\ntags: capacity, decentralization, farming\npublished_at: 2017-9-12\npost_image: airbnb-for-internet-capacity.jpg\n---\n\n![Logo](../assets/images/airbnb-for-internet-capacity.jpg)\n## Anyone is able to deliver capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.\n\n**In this article, we discuss the general concept of a ‘decentralized grid’.**\n\n### Decentralization\n\nIn 1989 the internet changed the world as we know it.

Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.\n2. Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of a marketplace operators.\n\nWe are at the dawn of a flat-structure economy. An economy where we need less managerial levels for the system to function in a good way.\n\nBlockchain technology facilitates this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis and form marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.\n\n### The internet is still centralized\n\nDespite already seeing many examples of decentralized currencies, transportation, and ledgers we do not yet have decentralized datacenter technology, the very core of the internet as we know it.\n\nTo compete in the internet capacity market which is currently dominated by big IT companies, requires massive investment and IT development.\n\nOver the last several years, ThreeFold has been developing decentralized datacenter technology that allows anyone to take part in the internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). \n\n### How to become a ThreeFold Farmer\n\nThe process of becoming a TF Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the TF Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS operating system onto nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold network. By doing so you will be an operator of a \"micro datacenter\" and earn TF Tokens. Anyone can become a TF Farmer, no matter the level of experience. Which means you can become an ‘Airbnb’ TF Farmer of the new, neutral internet which belongs to us all of us.\n\nInternet Capacity produced by a Zero-Node is automatically registered on the TF Directory. The TF Directory is a public directory of global purchasers of Internet Capacity. There is no need to build a marketing plan/department or to promote your available capacity.\n\nPricing is set by the TF Directory's algorithm based on numerous factors including real-time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment. TF Farmer are also allowed to set their own pricing.\n","tags":["capacity","decentralization","farming"],"published_at":"2017-9-12","author_name":"ahmed","author_email":"ahmed@there.com","author_image":"me.jpg","post_image":"airbnb-for-internet-capacity.jpg","excerpt":"\nAnyone is able to deliver capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.\nIn this article, we discuss the general concept of a ‘decentralized grid’.\nDecentralization\nIn 1989 the internet changed the world as we know it.
