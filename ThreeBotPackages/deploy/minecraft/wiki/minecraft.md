## Minercraft

Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and released
by Mojang in 2011.

The game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally
generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include
exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat.

Multiple game modes that change gameplay are available, including—but not limited to—a survival
mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a
creative mode, where players have unlimited resources to build with.

The Java Edition of the game allows players to modify the game with mods to create new gameplay
mechanics, items, textures and assets. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy
Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition
completed two months later.

Minecraft received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, and has been described as one of
the most influential and greatest video games in history. Social media, parodies, adaptations,
merchandise, and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing the game.

It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems,
as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it.

It is the single best-selling video game of all time, selling over 176 million copies across
all platforms by late 2019, while having over 112 million monthly active players.

A number of spin-off games have also been developed, such as Minecraft: Story Mode,
Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft Dungeons.
